# Food Recognition using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Food Recognition** using deep learning techniques. The model classifies images of food into different categories using **TensorFlow/Keras**. The dataset used for training is sourced from Kaggle.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **TensorFlow/Keras** 🤖
- **NumPy & Matplotlib** 📊
- **ImageDataGenerator for Data Augmentation** 🎨
- **Kaggle Food11 Dataset** 🍕

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle and consists of multiple food categories. It is preprocessed and augmented before training the model.

## 🔥 Key Features
✅ **Data Preprocessing & Augmentation**  
✅ **Deep Learning Model Development**  
✅ **Training & Evaluation of the Model**  
✅ **Food Classification with High Accuracy**
